1. **Create a database**:
   - Use a database management system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or any other of your choice.
   - Create a new database to hold the booking data.
   - Design the database schema with appropriate tables to store the booking information (e.g., bookings, users, rooms, etc.).
   - You can use a tool like MySQL Workbench to create the database and design the schema.

2. **Connect to the database using a Python client**:
   - Install a Python database connector library like `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL, `mysql-connector-python` for MySQL, or `sqlite3` for SQLite.
   - Write Python code to establish a connection to the database.
   - You need to provide the necessary connection details such as host, database name, username, and password.

3. **Create procedures to react to changes in the data**:
   - Implement procedures in Python to handle various operations like getting the maximum quantity, managing bookings, updating bookings, adding bookings, and canceling bookings.
   - These procedures should interact with the database by executing SQL queries based on the required functionality.

4. **Connect to the database using Tableau**:
   - Install Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public on your machine.
   - Connect Tableau to the database where you stored the booking data.
   - Use Tableau's connection interface to establish a connection to your database.

5. **Generate data reports using Tableau**:
   - Create data visualizations and reports in Tableau based on the booking data.
   - Utilize Tableau's features to create dashboards, charts, and graphs to present insights from the data.
   - Share and publish your Tableau reports as needed.

6. **GitHub repository**:
   - Create a GitHub repository for your project.
   - Include all your project files, including database scripts, Python scripts, ER diagram, and Tableau reports in the repository.
   - Ensure that the repository is well-organized and includes a README file with instructions on how to run the project.

7. **ER diagram**:
   - Include an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram in your GitHub repository.
   - The ER diagram should show the connections between the tables in your database schema.

8. **Implementation of procedures**:
   - Ensure that the `GetMaxQuantity()`, `ManageBooking()`, `UpdateBooking()`, `AddBooking()`, and `CancelBooking()` procedures are properly implemented in your Python code.
   - Test each procedure to ensure they work as expected and interact correctly with the database.
